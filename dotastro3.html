<h1>.Astronomy 3</h1>

<h2>New College, Oxford</h2>

<h2>April 4-8, 2011</h2>

<p><strong>Local Organisers:</strong> Robert Simpson, Chris Lintott, Arfon Smith.</p>

<p>.Astronomy 3 was the first event to use a conference-wide ‘shout’ email system. Nearly all attendees stayed within New College itself and the Hack Day went well into the night. The Turf Tavern proved popular in the evenings.</p>

  <h2>Chromotone</h2>
  <p>Exploring multiwavelength astronomy with sound. Each waveband has a pitch, the intensity/brightness in that waveband is represented by volume/loudness of the note. When you scan a mouse of an image Chromotone plays a chord with different components which correspond to the intensity at each pixel superposed. The original version was written in Processing which is not particularly web friendly so this project aims to make a version which is lighter, more efficient and has added functionality.
